== Welcome to my first rails app.

This is my first rails application. It is based on the depot application taken from the book "The 
Pragmatic Programmers Agile Web Development with Rails". Feel free to fork this application and play 
with this basic store.

The core features of this application include the ability to manage products, add items to your cart, 
checkout, check orders, and it also contains authentication that hashes passwords to prevent access 
to the administrative functions within the website.
